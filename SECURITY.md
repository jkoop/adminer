# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The AdminerEvo team only supports the last published version and the
last development version (last commit).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, create a new security advisory
[here](https://github.com/adminerevo/adminerevo/security/advisories).

Security issues are handled with top priority. Should a report go
unnoticed for more than a week, please send a message in the original
report thread.

Once acknowledged, a fix should be available and a new version
released within a week.

Security advisories will be made public after a fix and new version
have been released, or the advisory has been declined.
